If you're reading my code, I do apologize for my indulgence in details, that's who I am.
    If I can't build it from scratch, it's not fun,  I always get a feeling of less fulfillment, when I have to call a method.
Maybe I give too much to details? or maybe it's bececause C made me do everything from scratch? either way, do enjoy!
